day,# of students,comments
Week 1: Wednesday,,"This was supposed to be asych and I sent the email last week but still lots of
students missed it. Good thing I logged on anyway and explained it to the
students. Some students also had concerns and questions about the reading logs
so that was resolved. A couple students logged in late and I repeated the same
thing. Stayed until the end just to be safe.
