# Performance by Activity Type

Contains a method `performance_by_activity_type()` that will display graphs that summarise the performance of students
as classified by activity type on canvas.

The method takes in a parameter called `file_path` that should point to the location of the csv of the gradebook, and
another that will determine how many standard deviations are plotted on either side of the graph.
