# Clustering Tendency

Containing methods `clustering_tendency()` and `average_hopkins_statistic()`, which are used to assess the clustering
tendency of a given dataset.

Both visual and statistical assessments of clustering tendency are utilized. Namely, VAT & iVAT plots alongside
calculations for Hopkin's statistic.

Calling `clustering_tendency()` will return both forms of clustering tendency assessment.

> Note: The entire dataset is sampled in the calculation of Hopkin's statistic for reasons detailed in the clustering
> report, but this relates specifically to the nature of the data currently under investigation and should be
> re-investigated with new data sets.
