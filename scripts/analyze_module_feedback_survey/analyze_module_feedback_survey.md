### Class

3078650: When considering the topics covered in this course so far, I would say that for most of the modules in this course, the ideal format for delivering the lecture material to me is:

3078653: Considering that one lecture takes about 50 minutes scheduled class time, what was your experience with the time required to go through the content of each module? This question is about the lecture material only, and does not include the time for pre/post tests or any of the activities.

3078667: Which of the following modules did you find interesting? Check all that apply.

3078669: Overall, I found the "Quick Review" questions at the end of each page of the lecture material helpful in making sure I understand what I read.

3078708: Are there other suggestions you'd like to provide to help us improve the design of the modules and the associated lecture content?

### Tutorials
3079041: Completing the tutorials were optional and only used to improve my pre-test score for the module. In general, I completed the tutorial activities.

3078757: In general, I felt completing the tutorial activities improved my understanding of the material in the module.

3078741: Overall, I felt the time it took to complete the tutorial activities was reasonable.

3078807: In most cases, I got help during class time to complete the tutorial activities.

3078827: The tutorial activities in this class were designed to be done individually. At times, I collaborated with other students but I always made sure I understood the solutions and submitted my own work for the tutorials.

3078832: The tutorial activities in this class were designed to be done individually. I wish they could have been done in teams instead.

### Main Activities
3078844: In general, I felt completing the main activities improved my understanding of the material in the module more deeply than the tutorial activities or the lecture material alone. The main activities helped me appreciate the complexity of the theories, concepts, and techniques taught in the lecture material.

3078850: Overall, I felt the main activities furthered my interest in HCI.

3078838: Overall, I felt the time it took to complete the main activities was reasonable.

3078841: Overall, I felt the difficulty of the main activities was reasonable.

3078851: In most cases, I got help during class time to complete the main activities.

3078854: The main activities in this class were designed to be done in teams. For the most part, we divided up the work equally. I always made sure I participated in a portion of the activity to ensure I can understand the full solution.

3078856: The main activities in this class were designed to be done in teams. I wish they could have been done individually instead.

3079029: Overall, I enjoy completing the main activities.

### Pre/Post Tests

3078598: In general, I felt the pre-tests were helpful in identifying what I should learn from the module content beforehand.

3078599: In general, I felt that the post-tests fairly assessed whether I understand the module content.

3078610: Overall, I felt the time it took to complete the pre/post-tests was reasonable.

3078611: Overall, I felt the difficulty of the questions in the pre/post-tests were reasonable.

3078608: Overall, I prefer having pre-tests and post-tests for each module rather than having big midterms.

### Course Project
This section asks for your feedback about the project assignments in the first half of this course.

3078908: In general, I felt completing the project assignments improved my understanding of the material in the module more deeply than the other activities or the lecture material alone. These activities helped me appreciate the complexity of the theories, concepts, and techniques taught in the lecture material.

3078857: Overall, I felt the time it took to complete each project assignment was reasonable.

3078859: Overall, I felt the difficulty of the project assignments was reasonable.

3079028: Overall, I enjoyed completing the project assignments.

### General
This is the final section that asks for your feedback in some general aspects of the course.

3078597: In general, I feel my performance (e.g., my grades) in the pre-tests, post-tests, tutorial activities, and main activities reflect how skillful I am in these modules.
In particular, if I did not do well in a module, it is mostly because I was not good at the material. On the other hand, if I did well, it was mostly because I was good at the material.

3078594: In general, I feel my performance (e.g., my grades) in the pre-tests, post-tests, tutorial activities, and main activities reflect how interested I am in these modules.
In particular, if I did not do well in a module, it is mostly because I was not interested in the material. On the other hand, if I did well, it was mostly because I was interested in the material.

3078593: Any other suggestions you'd like to provide to help us improve these modules?
